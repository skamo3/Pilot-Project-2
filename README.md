# Basics knowledge of the Hardware
## What is CAN(Controller Arean Network)?
- Standard communication protocol designed for vehicles to communicate with each other within a vehicle
- **ECUs** in the vehicle communicate using the CAN protocol
### 장점
- Multi-Master
	- All nodes are bus masters and whenever the bus is empty they can send information 
- Twisted Pair Wire
	- Strong against electrical noise due to electrically differentiated communication using two lines : CAN_H, CAN_L
	- Scalability. Only need to connect to two lines, No matter how many ECUs.

- Message-Oriented Protocol
	- Use ID based on message priority. Use them to distinguish messages
	- Multiple messages come in at the same time, carry out the priority ID message 
> ECU
>	- Electronic Control Unit
>	- Electronic control device used in a car

## What is Arduino?
- Micro Controller
	-  Small electronic device that can easily handle various movements such as read data from sensors or use data to control motors.
	- C language (or C++) and Arduino IDE enable simple coding
	- Consists of Regulator, Circuit Element, GPIO
	- Peripherals allow direct control of external devices
	- [More Information of Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)
> GPIO 
>	- General Purpose Input/Output
>	- Uncommitted digital signal pin on an integrated circuit or electronic circuit board which may be used as an input or output, or both, and is controllable by software.
## What is Raspberry Pi?
- Micro Processor
	- Similar to Arduino, but called Processor because it can have various OSs
	- Unlike Arduino, there is no peripheral device and controls the device using an internal transistor
	- Powerful performance in computational processing, which is useful for complex computational processing such as video and graphics
	- [Raspberry Pi official document](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/)

- Basically, These materials can make communication. After connecting, you can connect Arduino with other modules(speed sensor, temperature sensor, etc) using Breadboard.

- VCC & 5V
  - You must find another 5Voltage socket in Pi Racer. Raspberry Pi 5V is already used for connecting Raspberry Pi & Pi Racer.
