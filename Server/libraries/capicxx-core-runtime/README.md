##### Build Instructions for Linux

Use CMake to build this library. We assume that your source directory is _common-api-runtime_:
 
```bash
$ cd common-api-runtime
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ make
$ make install
```

You can change the installation directory by the CMake variable _CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_ or you can let it uninstalled (skip the _make install_ command). Please refer to the installation description of the binding runtime how to use uninstalled versions of CommonAPI.

For further build instructions (build for windows, build documentation, tests etc.) please refer to the CommonAPI tutorial.
